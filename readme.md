This is a replica of twitter. The user can post and view tweets by other users. Currently when the user posts a tweet they have to send their name and story. We have not set up a user log in system yet. The website is hosted on an aws instance. Tweets are stored in a mysql data base that is within the the aws instance. The data base has one table called hisses which have the elements name and story. The link to the video above shows how it works in action. I made this for my final project in operating systems.

I worked with three other people on this project. My role was to set up the data base and work on viewing and posting the tweets as well as storing tweets in the database. The video above mentions towards the end that we tried to set up a jenkins pipeline to the github repo but it did not work. 

TODO: Make a login system and make the jenkins pipeline work
